# Socket.io

https://github.com/socketio/socket.io
Socket io is used in this application to enable bi-directional communication between the backend and the frontend (server and the client). When a new message is added, it's immediately shown.

# Frontend

Made with bootstrap

# Database

MongoDB, a noSQL db

# Tests

Run `npm test` to run the Jasmine test suite
Cannot natively make HTTP requests from the test files, so we installed "request", a library (`npm install --save-dev request`)
